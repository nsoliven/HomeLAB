# Personal Home Server Portfolio - My Home Lab

🖥️ Welcome to my home lab! This repository showcases the configuration and tools I use to manage my personal home server.  It's been a playground for learning and experimenting with various technologies.

## 📝 About My Home Lab

In my home, I run a dedicated server (my "home lab") that serves multiple purposes:

* **DNS Sinkhole:** Actively blocking malicious or unwanted domains to improve my network security.
* **Virtual Machines:** Running isolated environments for various projects and experiments.
* **Personally Hosted Websites:** Hosting my own websites and web applications.
* **Personal Cloud Storage:** Providing a secure and private place to store my data.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

My home lab setup leverages a mix of powerful tools:

* **Linux:** The foundation of my server, providing a stable and flexible operating system.
* **Docker:** For containerizing applications, making them easy to deploy and manage.
* **Docker Compose:** Streamlining the deployment of multi-container applications.
* **NGINX Proxy Manager:**  Securing my websites with HTTPS for privacy and trust.
* _Much more coming documentation coming_

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **docker-compose.yml:** Configuration files for deploying applications using Docker Compose.
* **scripts:** Helper scripts for managing various tasks on the server.
* **docs:** Additional documentation and notes on my setup and configurations.


## 🌱 Learning Journey

Through building and maintaining this home lab, I've gained valuable skills in:

* **Linux Administration:** Managing users, permissions, networking, and system services.
* **Docker and Containerization:** Packaging and deploying applications in isolated containers.
* **Networking and Security:** Configuring DNS, firewalls, and SSL certificates.
